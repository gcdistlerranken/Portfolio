    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <main id="faqs">
        <div id="accordion">
            <h3>What is BMI?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>BMI is an acronym for Body Mass Index, and it is an indicator
                    of the amount of fat which is stored in the human body. It
                    provides a measure of the appropriateness of your weight to
                    your height, based on health issues which are known to arise
                    as a result of having a BMI which is too low or too high.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Who invented BMI?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>The BMI formula and its name were invented by different people,
                    living in different centuries. The BMI formula was developed in
                    the 1830s by Adolphe Quetelet, a Belgian mathematician and social
                    statistician. He used his skills in calculus and statistics to
                    analyse the relationship between height and weight in populations,
                    and formulated what was known for 140 years as the Quetelet Index.
                    In 1972 the American biologist and physiologist Ancel Keys published
                    a paper endorsing the validity of the index, and in the process he
                    renamed it and popularised it as the Body Mass Index.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Why is BMI important?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>BMI is important as it is able to predict, with considerable accuracy,
                    mortality and morbidity rates in populations. What this means is that
                    BMI is not only able to predict the rates at which people within a given
                    population or group will die and suffer disease, but it is able to
                    predict the incidence of the different types of diseases which occur in
                    the population and which cause those deaths. However, as Adolphe Quetelet
                    and Ancel Keys stressed, BMI's predictive
                    abilities apply to populations only, and not to individuals within it.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>How is BMI calculated?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>BMI is calculated using only the variables of weight and height. Your
                    BMI is equal to your weight in kilograms divided by your height in metres
                    squared. You can also calculate your BMI using imperial units, in which
                    case your BMI is equal to your weight in pounds divided by your height
                    in inches squared, multiplied by 703.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>When should BMI be used?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>The calculation of BMI can be used for males and non-pregnant females
                    between the ages of 18 and 65. Although BMI is calculated for children in
                    exactly the same way as for adults, the results are used in an entirely
                    different way and for that reason a standard BMI calculator should not be
                    used for those under the age of 18. Also, the physiology of elderly people
                    differs from other adults (due to factors such as muscle wasting and height
                    reduction), and consequently BMI calculations should not be made for that
                    group. BMI calculations are also unsuitable for those who have developed
                    significant amounts of muscle mass through physical exercise, as the
                    results will tend to indicate higher levels of body fat than is actually
                    the case.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>What are the major BMI classifications?</h3>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li style="font-size: 110%;">BMI values less than 18.5 kg/m² are considered underweight.</li>
                    <li style="font-size: 110%;">BMI values from 18.5 kg/m² to 24.9 kg/m² are healthy.</li>
                    <li style="font-size: 110%;">Overweight is defined as a body mass index of 25.0 to less than 30.0 kg/m².</li>
                    <li style="font-size: 110%;">Obesity is defined as a BMI of 30.0 kg/m² or greater.</li>
                    <li style="font-size: 110%;">Extreme obesity is defined as a BMI of 40 kg/m² or greater.</li>
                </ul>
