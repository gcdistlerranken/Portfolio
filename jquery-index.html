        <p>It's fire road the entire way, absolutely zero singletrack. Other features include rock garden (that is rutted on the outer edges because XC peeps avoid it), skinny with twists and some other short elevated bridges. Just a few very small snow patches left on the connector to 38 Special. All hits are roll-able and built for progressing your jumping skillz. From there the trail stretches out and travels pretty fast into a big berm with a view out into the valley.</p>

    <aside>
        <p>The trails have a decidedly old school vibe with lots of rocks, roots, tight turns and steep pitches and are sure to keep even the most experienced riders on their toes. Please watch your speed on this portion though as this is a popular destination for hikers as well. Fast and flowing with big jump options and some pretty crazy gap jumps. Two wheel drifting is likely if you have speed but are not riding the top few inches of the berms. The trail finishes in switchbacks coming down the mountain with some good berms.</p>
